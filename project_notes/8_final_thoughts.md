# Final Thoughts

This project was definitely a bit of a challenge at some points, but towards the end I did start to pick up on quite a few things I struggled with towards the beginning. If I had a bit more time to work on this there are quite a few things that I would have done different and corrected. As of right now there are a few bugs, and it is missing quite a few exception cases.

## Troubles along the way

I faced quite a few issues and frustrations along the way, but as I progressed a lot of these things came together.

#### Designing the database

The initial configuring of the database gave me quite a bit of trouble, I haven't worked with relational databases in Rails, and its been quite awhile since I set these up in my other project.

I was kind of confused as to the way Rails handles this, and I am sure that what I did probably could use some corrections, but for as small as this project is they seem to flow together well. In the notes section I added a flowchart of the design.

#### Working with Rails templates

This part had me probably the most confused in the entire project and I spent a majority of my time trying to figure this out. If I were given more time I would have rather built the backend with Rails and the frontend in React. Building the Rails side of this project as an API would have been quite a bit easier.

This is another thing that I am sure could use quite a bit more work, but they do work in a basic sense for the amount of time I had to put them together.

## Takeaways from this project

It was a bit more difficult to work through than I original thought, I spent most of my time troubleshooting the database and and trying to figure out the templates, but I did learn quite a bit about Rails along the way.

I definitely have quite a bit more to learn, but I feel that this was a good start towards getting this down. Towards the end of the project, I gained a pretty solid understanding of how data is passed around within the framework and I am confident if I were to do this over it would have been quite a bit better quality based on what I learned.

I am excited to keep learning Rails, and am interested to see how your company handles various tasks with it.
